03/15 notes:
C program vs java programs —> 
C - 
- can be very tiny
- faster
- prerequisite is low
- can directly manipulate memory
- double edge sword: powerful but insecure 

Java -
- slow
- requires OS and a java virtual machine
- not good for small devices; better for systems (like banking systems)

other notes: 
- declare a pointer-type of variable named p, and initialize to the address of variable a.
- in a declaration, “*” stands for “pointer-type”. afterwards, “*” means “deference” retrieving the value at the memory location, using the syntax *p

int main (){
	int a = 0;
	int *p = &a;
	printf (“%ld” , (long)(p));
	return 0;

}

malloc = memory location
